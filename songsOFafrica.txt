African popular music (also styled Afropop, Afro-pop or Afro pop), like African traditional music, is vast and varied. 
Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many genres of
popular music like blues, jazz, afrobeats, salsa, zouk, and rumba derive to varying degrees on musical traditions from Africa,
 taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like rock,
 and rhythm and blues. Likewise, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and recording
 studio techniques of western music. The term does not refer to a specific style or sound,[1] but is used as a general term for African popular music.
