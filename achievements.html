        1. Math
        <br>
Surely only a few of us know that many modern high-school-level concepts in mathematics first were developed in Africa, as was the
 first method of counting. More than 35,000 years ago, Egyptians scripted textbooks about math that included division and multiplication
  of fractions and geometric formulas to calculate the area and volume of shapes . Distances and angles were calculated, algebraic equations 
  were solved and mathematically based predictions were made of the size of floods of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians considered a circle to have
   360 degrees and estimated Π at 3.16 .

         2.Astronomy
         <br>
Several ancient African cultures birthed discoveries in astronomy. Many of these are foundations on which we still rely,
 and some were so advanced that their mode of discovery still cannot be understood. Egyptians charted the movement of the
  sun and constellations and the cycles of the moon. They divided the year into 12 parts and developed a yearlong calendar system containing 365 ¼ days .
 Clocks were made with moving water and sundial-like clocks were used .

        3.Metallurgy and tools
        <br>
Many advances in metallurgy and tool making were made across the entirety of ancient Africa. These include steam engines, metal chisels and saws, copper and
 iron tools and weapons, nails, glue, carbon steel and bronze weapons and art .Advances in Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago surpassed
  those of Europeans then and were astonishing to Europeans when they learnedof them. Ancient Tanzanian furnaces could reach 1,800°C — 200 to 400°C warmer than those of the Romans .</section>

         4.Architecture and engineering
         <br>
Various past African societies created sophisticated built environments. Of course, there are the engineering feats of the Egyptians: the bafflingly raised obelisks and 
the more than 80pyramids. The largest of the pyramids covers 13 acres and is made of 2.25 million blocks of stone (3). Later, in the 12th century and much farther south, 
there were hundreds of great cities in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. There, massive stone complexes were the hubs of cities. One included a 250-meter-long, 15,000-ton curved granite wall

        5.Medicine
Many treatments we use today were employed by several ancient peoples throughout Africa. Before the European invasion of Africa, medicine in what is now Egypt, Nigeria
 and South Africa, to name just a few places, was more advanced than medicine in Europe. Some of these practices were the use of plants with salicylic acid for pain 
 (as in aspirin), kaolin for diarrhea (as in Kaopectate), and extracts that were confirmed in the 20th century to kill Gram positive bacteria (2). Other plants used had
  anticancer properties, caused abortion and treated malaria — and these have been shown to be as effective as many modern-day Western treatments.

    <section class="sec6"> 6.Navigation
Most of us learn that Europeans were the first to sail to the Americas. However, several lines of evidence suggest that ancient Africans sailed to South America
 and Asia hundreds of years before Europeans. Thousands of miles of waterways across Africa were trade routes. Many ancient societies in Africa built a variety of
  boats, including small reed-based vessels, sailboats and grander structures with many cabins and even cooking facilities. The Mali and Songhai built boats 100 feet
   long and 13 feet wide that could carry up to 80 tons (2). Currents in the Atlantic Ocean flow from this part of West Africa to South America. </section>
