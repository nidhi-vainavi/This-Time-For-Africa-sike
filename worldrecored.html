     Challenge soccer match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, on July 23 2009, before a derby match between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.</li> 

<li> Oldest person to begin primary school: <br> The world’s oldest person to begin primary school was aged 84; Kimani Ng’ang’a Maruge from Kenya enrolled into Standard One at Kapkenduiyo
 Primary School, Eldoret, in January 2004. </li>

<li> Most children fathered: <br> The last Sharifian Emperor of Morocco, Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, known as The Bloodthirsty, was reputed to have fathered a total of 867 children – 525
 sons and 342 daughters – between 1672 and 1727. The number two record is held by another African, King Sobhuza II of Swaziland, who lived between 1899–1982 and fathered 210
  children from 70 wives. </li> 

<li> Most official languages: <br> The country with the most official languages is South Africa, with 11. These are: English, Afrikaans, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, Setswana, Sepedi,

 on its territory. </li>

<li> Largest mud brick building: <br> The Great Mosque of Djenné (surface area of 5625 square metres) in Mali is the world’s largest mud brick building. First built around
 the 13th century, the current structure dates from 1907. *Random bonus fact: In 1996, Vogue magazine held a fashion shoot inside the mosque. Vogue’s pictures of
  scantily-dressed women outraged local opinion, and as a result, non-Muslims have been banned from entering the mosque ever since. </li>

<li> Deadliest lake: <br> The world’s deadliest is Lake Nyos in Cameroon, where toxic gases have claimed at least 2 000 lives in recent decades. In just one night in August
 1986, between 1 600-1 800 people were killed by a large release of carbon dioxide. </li>

<li> Shortest war: The Anglo-Zanzibar war in August 1896 lasted just 38 minutes. Around 500 Zanzibari men and women were killed or wounded during the bombardment
 by the British, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. Only one British sailor was injured.</li>

<li> Loudest insect: <br> The African Cicada (Brevisana brevis) produces a mean sound level of 120 decibels, equivalent to the sound of a rock concert, a jet engine,
 or a thunderclap.</li></section>

<li> Most people brushing their teeth simultaneously (multiple venues): <br> In 2013, students in Nigeria broke the record in brushing teeth (previously set by India) when 300 000
 students from 600 public secondary schools in Lagos brushed their teeth simultaneously for one minute at 376 different locations.</li> 

<li> Largest game of pick up sticks: <br> Measuring 9.10m long and 14.5cm in diameter, the biggest game of pick up sticks was  played by the pupils of St. Johns Preparatory School
 in Zimbabwe on July 21 2007. The game consisted of 30 plastic sticks (seven yellow, seven red, seven blue, eight green and one black). A full game was played by four teams of 112 children each. </li>
