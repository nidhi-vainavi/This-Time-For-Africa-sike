        The continent of Africa is comprised of 54 countries, more than 1.3 billion people, and more than 3,000 tribes.
One thing you will discover during your visit is that tribal influences are a dominant force in some regions across the continent.

    <section class="sec2">
        The Biggest tribe is:Yoruba, Nigeria
<br>
With an estimated 35 million people in total, Yoruba is undeniably the largest ethnic group in Africa. Members occupy the South Western
 sides of Nigeria, as well as Southern Benin, but the majority comes from Nigeria. They have a rich history and cultural heritage tracing back to the old Oyo Empire
    </section>
    <section class="sec5">
        The Smallest Tribe:Pygmy,Africa
<br>
  commonly held belief is that African Pygmies are the direct descendants of Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer peoples of the central African rainforest
  , who were partially absorbed or displaced by later immigration of agricultural peoples, and adopted their Central Sudanic, Ubangian, and Bantu languages
  . This view has no archaeological support, and ambiguous support from genetics and linguistics
    </section>
    <section class="sec3">
     The popular Tribe:Zulu, South Africa
<br>
Zulu is one of the most popular tribes in Africa.  One reason why the tribe is so widely known is because of Shakaland, which is acknowledged worldwide
 as the birthplace of the legendary chief Shaka Zulu.With an estimated population of 11 million people, Zulu is known to be the largest ethnic group in South Africa.

    <section class="sec4">
       The unpopular/unknown tribe:Bolivia
<br>
The Toromona are an uncontacted people living near the upper Madidi River and the Heath Rivers in northwestern Bolivia.[22] The government has created an "exclusive,
 reserved, and inviolable" portion of the Madidi National Park to protect the Toromona.Among the Ayoreo people of the Gran Chaco are a small number of uncontacted nomadic
  hunter-gatherers in the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area.Pacahuaras are believed to be living in voluntary isolation in Pando Department.
