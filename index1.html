   <b> Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles)
 including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts
for about 16% of the world's human population. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population
 make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context. We think Africa looks like a deserted continent but It is a intelligent continent with lack of facilities. </b>

        <b> The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the
 Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states (countries), eight territories
and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations
 cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.</b>

    <section class="sec4">
        <b> Africa straddles the Equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.The majority
 of the continent and its countries are in the Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Africa is home to much biodiversity;
  it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. However, Africa also is heavily affected
   by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, and other issues.  The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified
    Africa as the most vulnerable continent to climate change.</b>

        <b> Africa, particularly Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), meaning that Africa has a long and complex history.
 The earliest hominids and their ancestors have been dated to around 7 million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis,
  Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) remains, found in Ethiopia, South Africa, and Morocco, date to circa 200,000, 259,000,
   and 300,000 years ago respectively, and Homo sapiens is believed to have orignated in Africa around 350,000â€“260,000 years ago.</b>

    <section class="sec6">
        Early human civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt and Phoenicia emerged in North Africa. Following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations
, migration and trade, Africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. The last 400 years have witnessed an increasing European influence
 on the continent.
