Bearded goats
   In Rwanda (Africa), goats are plentiful. 
    They are found not only on farms all over the country, but also on the menus of most local restaurants.
     However, women are encouraged not to eat goat meat, due to the belief that it could cause them to grow a beard.</section>

Witches and geese
    At an apartment complex in the Kenyan village of Kakamega (Africa), locals believe the resident geese only quack at witches. 
         As a result, they are the only security required at the compound, and every time the geese quack,  people are quite sure that there are some witches about.

Egg-eating fish
         On Pemba island, just off the coast of mainland Tanzania (Africa), a small shrine on the island sits among lush mangroves. 
             Tanzanians visit the pond next to the shrine to make wishes and offerings by throwing an egg into the water. 
             If the egg is eaten by the fish in the pond, it is said that your wish will be granted.

Ringing in the New Year
             In Uganda (Africa), actions taken on New Year’s Day are said to set the tone for the rest of the year. 
                 Superstition states that Ugandans shouldn’t lend or receive money on January 1, or do too much work, 
                 lest they stay in debt for the year and never get to take a proper vacation.

                 Ominous owls
                 Seeing an owl in Kenya (Africa) is considered to be a bad omen.
                     It could indicate an upcoming funeral, trouble with work, or more or less anything unfortunate. 
                      It is also thought that shooing the owl away after seeing it or throwing salt in the fire will help to counteract the upcoming misery.

                     <section class="sec7"> Itchy palms
                      In Kenya, (Africa) if your right palm is itchy, people believe you will soon receive a windfall of money.  You can’t scratch your right hand, however,
                         as it will “scratch the money away.”  Instead, you should scratch your left hand so that you don’t lose the money.</section>
